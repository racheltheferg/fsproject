                  <p>In the 1880s saloon keeper William Mohs contributed $500 for the construction of a fountain in the center of The End’s growing commercial district. Other local merchants matched his generous donation and, in 1889, the first fountain was unveiled.</p> 

                  <p>Known alternately as the “Subscription Fountain,” the “Lady of the Fountain,” and, most popularly, “Lady Spray,” the fountain served as a drinking area for both horses and humans. It was also a streetlight, with two cantilevered lamps. The design was classical, with an octagonal base, four dolphin-head spouts and an ornate pedestal topped by a statue of Hebe, the Greek goddess of youth.</p> 

                  <p>It is presumable that the name “Fountain Square” can be attributed to the arrival of Lady Spray. Though the exact date of the name’s origin is unknown, it had already been adopted by 1909 when the Fountain Square Theater was constructed on Virginia Avenue.</p>

                  <p>The fountain stood for nearly 30 years until, as legend has it, a local shopkeeper attached a banner to the Lady’s arm and a strong wind caused her to topple. The fate of Lady Spray after that time is unknown.</p>
