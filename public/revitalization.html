                  <p>In 2004, Southeast Neighborhood Development (SEND), a nonprofit community development group, received a $500,000 federal grant for improvements to the Fountain Square area. In partnership with Green 3 architects and Ninebark landscape designers, the organization developed a 10-15 year phased plan, including the construction a new public plaza and fountain.</p> 

                  <p>On March 12, 2010, a new “Lady Spray” was dedicated. Created from molds of a 19th century fountain in Watertown, NY, the fountain was topped once again by the goddess Hebe. Though not an exact replica of the 1889 fountain, according to Ann Reed of Ninebark, “the primary intent was to return a version of Lady Spray, not a slavish reproduction of the original Subscription fountain.”</p>

                 <p>The new fountain is surrounded by a field of weathered limestone, quarried in southern Indiana. While limestone is typically carved into smooth, refined shapes, the blocks selected for Lady Spray’s stone field feature their natural rugged surfaces. The organic texture is an intentional visual contradiction to the ornate, Victorian style of the fountain, symbolizing the pioneer spirit and paying homage to The Pioneer Family, which was installed in a new location across the street. The stone field also serves a practical purpose, protecting the fountain from surrounding traffic.</p>
