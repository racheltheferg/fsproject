                  <p>In September 1924, a new fountain was unveiled: a bronze sculpture depicting a pioneer family—father, mother, and two children—facing westward. It was constructed as a monument to the late Indiana Congressman Ralph Hill, whose wife had left a portion of her estate for the honor.</p> 

                  <p>The Pioneer Family occupied the busy intersection of Prospect, Shelby and Virginia for thirty years. Throughout the 1920s and 30s, Fountain Square thrived, boasting a vibrant commercial district and more theaters than any other part of the city. But the 1950’s brought hard times to the neighborhood. One by one, the district’s theaters closed. The German and Irish populations that had been the cornerstone of Fountain Square for decades began to move away; and, in a sad symbol of the times, The Pioneer Family was evicted.</p> 

                  <p>Citing traffic issues, city officials moved The Pioneer Family to the Garfield Park Conservatory in 1954. It wasn’t until 1969, under pressure from the neighborhood community organization, that the fountain was restored to its home on the square.</p>

                 <p>The Pioneer Family was created by Indiana sculptor Myra Reynolds Richards. Richards studied at the studied at the John Herron Art Institute in the early 20th century and also served as an instructor at the school. In her life she gained national recognition for her work, which was shown in Chicago, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Paris.</p>
