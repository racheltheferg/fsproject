                  <p>The development of Fountain Square began in 1835 when urban pioneers Calvin Fletcher and Nicolas McCarty purchased a 264-acre farm south of downtown Indianapolis and divided it into town lots. Over the next several decades a small community developed, with several churches and a school to serve the large number of Irish immigrants who settled there. By mid-century, the area became known as “Irish Hill.”</p>

                  <p>In 1864, the Citizens Street Railway Company announced plans to expand their horse-drawn streetcar service down Virginia Avenue to the intersection of Prospect and Shelby Streets. In addition to a new nickname (the neighborhood became known as “The End” in honor of the streetcar terminus) the streetcar also ushered in new commercial and residential growth. Stores, shops, saloons and churches sprang up to cater to a growing population.</p>
                  
                  <p>In 1892 the City of Indianapolis completed the Virginia Avenue viaduct, further improving access to the southeast neighborhood.</p>

                    <p>In the late 1800s Fountain Square was commercialized largely by German shop keepers along Virginia Avenue&mdash;such as this one, advertised in the 1890 Indianapolis City Directory.</p>
